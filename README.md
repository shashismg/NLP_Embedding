# Embedding Assignment

## Overview

This project explores **multiple text embedding techniques** using a chosen dataset. By implementing different methods—**Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText**—we demonstrate how to convert raw text into meaningful numerical vectors. These embeddings help in deeper analysis and extraction of insights from text data.

## Problem Statement

The assignment focuses on **exploring foundational and advanced text embedding techniques**. You will compare their principles, implementation, applications, strengths, and limitations. Each method is applied to the dataset, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed for meaningful insights.

## Guidelines

- **Learn the basics:**  
  Understand each embedding technique, including vector space models, word embeddings, and the role of context in text representation.
- **Compare methods:**  
  Examine where each embedding works well or falls short.
- **Document the process:**  
  Provide detailed code, explanations, and insights for each step.

## Step-by-Step Approach

### 1. Setup and Data Preparation
- Import required libraries:  
  `pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk`, `sklearn`, `gensim`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Load your dataset of choice.
- Preprocess the data: cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.

### 2. Bag of Words (BoW)
- Use **CountVectorizer** (from `sklearn`) to create a BoW representation.
- Analyze the resulting **sparse matrix** and interpret **word frequencies**.

### 3. TF-IDF
- Use **TfidfVectorizer** to create TF-IDF vectors.
- Analyze how **TF-IDF scores** capture word importance relative to the dataset.

### 4. Word2Vec
- Use **Gensim’s Word2Vec** to train word vectors on the dataset.
- Visualize and interpret the learned word embeddings.

### 5. GloVe
- Load **pre-trained GloVe vectors** and map dataset words to these embeddings.
- (Optional) Train a GloVe model using your dataset.

### 6. FastText
- Use **Gensim’s FastText** to produce word embeddings considering subword information.
- Analyze and compare these vectors to Word2Vec and GloVe.

## Dataset

Any suitable text dataset can be used. The embeddings are generated and analyzed based on this dataset.
